# NothingAtAll 
A simple text based adventure game  (Or at least it will be at some point)  
There isn't really much to show for it yet, so stay tuned!


The 'dev' branch may be slightly more up to date than this branch  
## How to Compile
We use the CMake build system, so the easiest way to build is by cloning the source then typing the following commands:  
```console
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ../
```
Then open up the project in your IDE or compiler of choice (if you use MSVC you may have to swap <unistd.h> with <Windows.h>  
You can call the directory whatever you want, it doesn't have to be build.
