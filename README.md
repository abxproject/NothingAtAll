# NothingAtAll
A simple text based adventure game (Or at least it will be at some point)  
There isn't really much to show for it yet, so stay tuned!

## How to Compile
We use the CMake build system, so the easiest way to compile is by cloning the source then typing the following commands:  
```console
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ../
```
You can call the directory whatever you want, it doesn't have to be build.
